                   <p> Okay let’s just put this out there - meditation is hard. But there’s a reason so many people continue to do it. The effects of a regular meditation practice on mental and physical health are truly life-changing.</p> 
                   <p> Eastern cultures have known this for centuries, but more recently, psychologists, neurobiologists and other researchers have proven that mediation has a ton of benefits. From literally changing the biology of the brain, to subjective reports of feeling healthier and happier, there are some pretty solid reasons why meditation should become part of our regular routine. </p>
        <p> But I get it - meditation is a challenge. Finding the time, or the motivation to do it takes practice to overcome. And even when I am able to incorporate it into my daily routine - there are so many days where I feel like it’s just not “working” the way it should. </p></div>

        <p> But after 6 years of practicing yoga and meditation, and gradually focusing more on my meditative and spiritual practices, I’ve noticed a HUGE difference in my own approach to life. Over time, meditation has given me a sense of peace like nothing else can, it has made me more compassionate and empathetic. Meditation grounds me, helps me make better decisions, and helps me navigate some really big challenges with mental illness. I cannot praise it enough, yet each and every day I humbly remember that it is a PRACTICE, and it is really about the journey more than the end results.  </p>
        
        <p> I’m no expert, but if you want to get started, or want to build on an existing meditation practice, here are some tricks that have worked wonders for me. </p>
