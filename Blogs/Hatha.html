        <h1> Hatha Yoga </h1>
             
                   <p> Hatha Yoga, (Sanskrit: “Discipline of Force”) school of Yoga that stresses mastery of the body as a way of attaining a state of spiritual perfection in which the mind is withdrawn from external objects. Hatha Yoga traces its origins especially to Gorakhnath, the legendary 11th-century founder of the Kanphata Yogis, but it grew out of yogic traditions dating back at least as far as Patanjali (2nd century BCE or 5th century CE), author of the Hindu classics the Yoga-sutras and the Mahabhasya (“Great Commentary”). </p>

                   <p> Hatha Yoga places great importance on diet, purificatory processes, regulation of breathing (Pranayama), and the adoption of bodily postures called asanas, which structure a program of physical exertion. A common asana is the padmasana (“lotus posture”), in which the crossed feet rest on the opposite thighs. This is the position in which many Hindu and Buddhist gods are often depicted, but it is only one of dozens described in Hatha Yoga treatises. The “salute to the sun” is a well-known sequence of 12 asanas performed in a fluid movement.  </p>
